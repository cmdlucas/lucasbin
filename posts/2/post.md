You don't need to go too far searching for a `react` library. This is the `code` for it. : 

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ImageSelectPreview from 'react-image-select-pv';

const SimpleDiv = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <ImageSelectPreview />
        </div>
    )
}

export default React.memo(SimpleDiv)
```
